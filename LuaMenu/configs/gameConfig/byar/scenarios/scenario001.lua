All units can pass through the central shallow isthmus, with the notable exception of Fleas. The shallow water connects the two seas, and control over the vast amount of metal they hold is key to victory.

Score:
    1. Speed: destroy the enemy Commanders as fast as possible.
    2. Efficiency: minimize the amount of metal and energy used.

Tips:
    1. The map contains many rocks, reclaim them for metal to quickly progress.
