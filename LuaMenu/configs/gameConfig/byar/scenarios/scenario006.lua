    briefing        = [[Both you and your enemy may only make infantry units. Since you're up against a larger enemy, be sure to expand quickly and reclaim/resurrect effectively to maintain an advantage. Don't forget to raid the enemy!

Score:
    1. Speed: destroy the enemy Commanders as fast as possible.
    2. Efficiency: minimize the amount of metal and energy used.

Tips:
    1. Light laser towers are incredibly effective against small amounts of infantry.
    2. Resurrecting a fallen infantry unit will immediately add it to your army. Use this to stage epic comebacks.
    3. Infantry can be very effective at finding and killing enemy commanders. Be sure to take control of the wreck after killing the first one.
    4. AKs have more range than Peewees, but less damage for their cost. Both have their strengths and weaknesses!
