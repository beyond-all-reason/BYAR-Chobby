Tips:
 
 ‣  The Cortex Duck (Tier 2 Bot) amphibous bot armed with a short-range laser, and a torpedo launcher. It is the only amphibous unit capable of firing while underwater.
 
 ‣  The Armada Platypus (Tier 2 Bot) has a short range laser, and an Anti-Aircraft missile, and can provide excellent raiding and support while swimming above the water.
 
 ‣  Some Experimental Gantry (Tier 3) units are amphibious, and some stand tall enough to fire their weapons at surfact targets while in water.
 
 ‣  Large maps provide great incentives to use Nuclear Missiles, so take care to defend yourself with either: Land nuclear missile defence or a mobile form of it.
 
 ‣  Aircraft carriers can repair aircraft while at sea, and even have an anti-nuclear missile.
 
 ‣  Flagships offer the highest concentration of ranged firepower possible.
 
 ‣  Torpedo bombers can quickly dispose of any fleet without sufficient anti-air cover.
 
 
Scoring:

 ‣  Time taken to destroy all enemy units
 ‣  Resources spent to kill the enemy commander
