# Developing the Lobby

1. Download using one of the links above and start the application.

2. Start the application once and launch the lobby. This will download the engine and other dependencies.

3. Open the install directory (there's a button for that in the launcher), and create a `games` directory, then clone this repository inside the `games` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/BYAR-Chobby.git BYAR-Chobby.sdd
```

This should result in the following directory being present: `/path/to/install/dir/data/games/BYAR-Chobby.sdd/` under . (`Beyond-All-Reason\data\games\BYAR-Chobby.sdd\LuaMenu\configs\gameConfig` should be a correct path)

**NOTE**: The games directory is `data/games` under windows, and just `games` under Linux.

4. Choose the `Dev Lobby` config from the launcher's top right dropdown menu which will run the lobby version on your PC. You can now develop and test any BYAR specific lobby functionality.

5. If you want to develop Chobby itself, clone it in the `games` directory similar to step 3:

```
git clone https://github.com/Spring-Chobby/Chobby.git Chobby.sdd
```

You must also change the `depend` table in `BYAR-Chobby.sdd/modinfo.lua` to use `Chobby $VERSION` instead of `rapid://chobby:test`.

To enable debugmode, make an empty `devmode.txt` in the already used game install directory (`/data/`), and then the `Settings/Developer` tab will appear in the lobby. All debug messages are visible in th Debug chat panel.

# Developing the Game

1. Make sure you've first finished setting up the lobby development environment (previous section)

2. Open the install directory, and inside the `games` directory clone the BAR *game* repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/Beyond-All-Reason.git BAR.sdd
```

3. Start Chobby with `Dev Lobby` config, open the `Settings/Developer` tab and in the `Singleplayer` option choose `Beyond All Reason Dev`. The application title should change to `Beyond All Reason Dev`.

4. Choose Skirmish as you normally would - this will put you in a match against one Null AI by default - and start it. This should start Beyond All Reason with your local development version. You should see `Beyond All Reason $VERSION` in your window title.

## Tips for BYAR-Chobby development:

1. Use Zerobrane Studio dev env, open up any chobby Beyond-All-Reason\data\*.lua file with Zerobrane studio, then set Project->Project Directory->From current file
2. This allows you to ctrl+shift+f to find any text in all of chobby, useful
3. Do NOT try to edit anything in Chobby.sdd! If you want to edit something in Chobby.sdd that is not overwritten by the mutator BYAR-Chobby (e.g. does not exist in BYAR-Chobby.sdd), then copy it over to BYAR-Chobby.sdd first and commit it (so we have a baseline).
4. Open infolog.txt in notepad++ or anything to grep for errors.

## How to make new launcher releases:

Note: Windows executables are signed, this procedure can be done only by one of the developers that have code signing cerificate.

1. Modify a file in the `dist_cfg` folder (https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/BYAR-Chobby/tree/master/dist_cfg) on the `master` branch to trigger a launcher build. It should start a new action here: https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/BYAR-Chobby/actions
2. Wait until the build **completely** finishes (the action should be green and have a check), otherwise you might create an incomplete release.
3. Make a pre-release by finding the latest Draft here https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/BYAR-Chobby/releases, open it:
   - click `Edit draft`
   - Mark it as "pre-release"
   - then `Publish Release`
4. Use `build/sign_release.py` to sign the new launcher binary, e.g.

   ```
   python ./build/sign_release.py --signtool 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.19041.0\x64\signtool.exe' v1.1832.0
   ```

5. Edit release:
   - replace the Windows executable and `latest.yml` file with the singed version and new generated `latest.yml`
   - untick pre-release and mark it as latest release
6. Send new download links to .exe and .AppImage to BAR discord #website so download links on website can be updated.
7. Note that pr-downloader is fetched from https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/spring-launcher
